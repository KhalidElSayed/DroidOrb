Android app:
===========

bugs:
- service running in background even after exiting app
  - prevents app from working when re-loaded

- when phone is ringing, blink white LED
- missed call notification
- new e-mail notification
- new SMS notification
- config screen to set colours and pulse rates

- When "lights off" event received, put phone into vibrate mode
- When "lights on" event received, put phone back into previous state
- Add configuration for above

Arduino firmware:
===============

- set the upper and lower limits of pulse rates to practical values
- use light sensor value to adjust brightness of orb
