Android app:
===========

- app to run as a service
- "test" button on the main interface for testing
- when phone is ringing, blinkg white LED
- missed call notification
- new e-mail notification
- new SMS notification
- config screen to set colours and pulse rates

- When "lights off" event received, put phone into vibrate mode
- When "lights on" event received, put phone back into previous state
- Add configuration for above

Arduino firmware:
===============

- set the upper and lower limits of pulse rates to practical values
- implement phone command to read light sensor value
- use light sensor value to adjust brightness of orb
- send "lights off" event to phone when light sensor reaches lower threshold
  - then send "lights on" when it goes higher again (with hysteresis)
